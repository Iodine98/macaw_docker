# Macaw on Docker
This is a multi-container Docker application, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is required to run [Macaw](https://github.com/microsoft/macaw). As of now, this application **does not** start Macaw. It installs all dependencies to run Macaw and creates and interactive environment where you can all scripts pertaining to Macaw.

The application is built on the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/roynirmal/pyndri) for [Pyndri](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri) which is a Python interface to the Indri search engine. 

At the moment, this image contains:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Python 3.6.9
- Retrieval back-end systems:
  * Indri 5.11
  * Pyndri 0.4 
- Java 11.0.6
- Stanford Core NLP
- Macaw

The first three images are built in the container for Pyndri. We build the last three on top of that in this macaw docker application. 

## Instructions
First Time:
1. Open your terminal and clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/roynirmal/macaw_docker`. 
2. Run `cd macaw_docker`.
3. Run the following command: `docker-compose up --build` (don't close this terminal)
4. This will retrieve the necessary images for Ubuntu, Python3, Indri, Pyndri, Stanford Core NLP and finally Macaw itself; and build the containers
5. To start an interactive development environment (with the above mentioned packages installed) that shares a folder with your local (host): `docker run -it -v /host/path:/container/path macaw_docker_app`.

   `-it` enables the interactive environment `-v /host/path:/container/path` mounts the volume `/host/path` seen inside the image as `/container/path`.

6. To close the application, press `Ctrl+A+D` on the terminal.

We will start off with running a bare-bone version of Macaw using the [WikiPassageQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03797.pdf) dataset and `Indri` index. For that perform the following steps: 
1. Get the dataset using the command `wget https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/wikipassageqa/WikiPassageQA.zip`. Ofcourse you can install any dataset you want here. We use WikiPassageQA because it is light weight and does the job ;)
2. Unzip it `unzip WikiPassageQA.zip`. 
3. ```python 
docs = json.load(open('document_passages.json'))
finput = open('input_file.txt', 'w+')

for i in range(len(docs)):
    for doc_id in docs[str(i)].keys():
        finput.write('<DOC>\n')
    
        finput.write('<DOCNO>'+ str(i)+'-'+str(doc_id) +'</DOCNO>\n')
        finput.write('<TEXT>\n')
        finput.write(docs[str(i)][str(doc_id)]+'\n')
        finput.write('</TEXT>\n')
        finput.write('</DOC>\n')
    
finput.close()
```


The process to re-open the application with the stored data is very similar:
1. Open a terminal and go to the folder location
2. Run the following command: `docker-compose up` (don't close this terminal)
3. Docker will start the pre-built containers
4. You can open the application in the interactive environment with `docker run -it macaw_docker_app`
5. To close the application, press `Ctrl+A+D` on the terminal
